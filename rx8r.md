Inside the RX8R
===============

The RX8R consists of a primary PCB and a radio submodule.

The top of the primary PCB has the F/S switch, several pads - GND, 3.3V, SWCLK and SWDIO (the text for SWCLK is largely obscured by a black mark) - and two sets of connections labelled CON4 and J1.

Looking at the radio submodule from the top edge we can see two more sets of connections, these ones labelled CON2 and CON5.

Looking at the underside of the radio submodule one can just make out another set of connections, labelled P3.
