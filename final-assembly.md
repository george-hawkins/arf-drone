Final assembly
=============

First pass at final assembly. Next add in the comments included with the photos in Google Photos. Rename the image files to more informative names. Then work in all the Post-its etc.

Order:

* GPS mast base.
* Damping platform.
* ...

Many of the images here can probably be discarded.

There's little gained in showing any of these bases (except perhaps the FCMODEL) from other angles.

An M3x10mm bolt, a 3.2x8x0.8mm washer and an M3 [locknut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locknut) for attaching a four-screw-hole style GPS mast base to the F450 top plate. The bolt here is 10mm which is a little long, 9mm would be perfect and 8mm would be too short.

_09._  
<img src="images/assembly/final-assembly/IMG_20170908_122219.jpg" width="512">

The inner slot is much wider than the outer and you'd need washers with a larger diameter than typically come with the 3.2mm hole size that matches our bolts.

_03._  
<img src="images/assembly/final-assembly/IMG_20170907_115501.jpg" width="512">

You'd have to snip off the inner "loops" of the base rather than let them extend under the damping platform.

Use masking tape to see how the base will sit relative to the top plate and to confirm that how you layout the VHB tape on the damping platform base won't leave any tape entirely over a hole or on top of a bolt head.

Note: the damping platform base has mounting holes and comes with bolts but even if you wanted to you couldn't drill the top plate so that you could bolt it down as the mounting holes end up directly over the plastic ends of the arms.

The platform designed specifically for the Pixhawk, rather than the APM, has a slightly wider base which mean the feet would be over bolts - but this wouldn't cause an issue as unlike the other platform the rubber XXXs don't extend below the bottom of the platform's base plate.

VHB neatly cut to the desired lengths and widths with the help of parchment paper. I didn't sand any of the surfaces but I did make sure they were very clean using isopropyl alcohol. I did this here for the plates of the damping platform and for the top F450 plate and the underside of the Pixhawk that the platform is attached to. I did it also for the GPS module and the GPS mast head that it is stuck to and for the end of the mast and the bottom socket that it's plugged into (before applying epoxy glue).

I did buy sandpaper but only used it on the end of the GPS mast (before glueing it into its socket), in other situations I forgot to use it (e.g. here with the damping platform). Apparently the most important things with VHB tape are having clean surfaces and applying as much pressure as you can when sticking surfaces together.

For a nice article on getting the most out of VHB tape see [this](https://www.headphonesty.com/2017/06/how-to-10x-3m-vhb-tape-adhesiveness/) on Headphonesty.

I bought sandpaper with a [CAMI 400](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandpaper#Grit_sizes) grit size (KWB [830-400](https://www.kwb.eu/de/detail/index/sArticle/2950698/sCategory/3131985) paper) - for no better reason than this was the finest sandpaper at the hardware store before one got into what was classed as ultra fine (where it was hard to feel any abrasiveness).

None of the surfaces involved, e.g. the plastic of the damping platform here, reacted badly to isopropyl alcohol but in the case of the Pixhawk and GPS module I took care to make sure it didn't come near to any of the electronics and didn't spray it on directly to devices containing electronics.

Some portions of the VHB tape end up over holes in the F450 top plate once attached. I did plan to apply talc to exposed portions like this - to avoid random gunk getting stuck to them over time - but forgot, by the time I remembered too much assembly had been done for it to still be easy to get at these areas anymore.

Note: when stripping down and rebuilding look at how feasible it really is to talc these points - maybe they're impossible to get at.

One thing to take into account when applying VHB tape to the lower half of the platform is the position of the bolts on the top F450 plate (that hold on the arms). In the photo below the large pieces of VHB tape at the top and bottom of the lower platform are shorter left-to-right than they might be - this is in order to avoid those raised bolt heads.

<img src="images/assembly/final-assembly/IMG_20170908_150250.jpg" width="512">

I can't conclusively say, without some lab analysis, that the parchment paper had no detrimental affect on the VHB tape, but it would seem not - I could lift the entire craft (including battery) by the vibration damping platform without the tape giving way.

TODO: move above two pictures of the other damping platform (and probably some of the other stuff here) into [`vibration-damping-platform.md`](vibration-damping-platform.md) and note that the rubber feet of this platform end up sitting on bolt heads on the F450 top plate - the rubber feet and the raised bolt heads combine to form a gap between F450 top plate and damping platform underside of about 2.5mm (of this a tiny bit more than half is the foot) which makes the gap too big for standard VHB tape.

Added GPS base.

TODO: add picture of washer and split washer, i.e. the bits that didn't come with the mast.

TODO: mark out photos that were taken later to fill in things that had been missed, like using the socket driver via the lower plate slot, and are out of sequence.

_[*] 56._  
<img src="images/assembly/final-assembly/IMG_20170910_232256.jpg" height="512">

Used 5.5mm socket driver - hole in bottom plate makes it easy to get at the bolt but should have done it before mounting anything else.

<img src="images/assembly/final-assembly/IMG_20170909_152942.jpg" height="512">

Important: we need to make sure to keep the left/right cavity free of obstructions so that the battery can be slid in easily - if the nut holding the GPS mast in place descended a few millimeters more it would be a problem.

Mast setup part 1 (of 2).

Above the GPS base before insertion of mast with epoxy.

<img src="images/assembly/final-assembly/IMG_20170908_164942.jpg" height="512">

Above the GPS base after inserting mast with epoxy. Excess epoxy cleaned off with tissue. Note: epoxy is very toxic, do not get in eyes and clean off skin.

Doing the epoxying at this stage meant I could get leaving this to dry overnight out of the way at the same time as clamping the Pixhawk. In retrospect I'd leave the Pixhawk clamped one evening and do the rest of the assembly the next day, doing the mast setup as the last part (see below where I add the GPS module itself - both this and adding the mast here were done prematurely). I'd add the GPS module to the top component of the mast as one of the last steps on the next day and have everything else ready (mast cleaned and base cleaned and lower mast end sandpapered) but only do the actual epoxying before going to bed.

So I'd move attaching the base of the mast to be the very first thing I do (before attaching the damping platform) but move everything else to do with it to the end.

Here I used a suitable UHU epoxy but I later bought [J-B Weld epoxy](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0006O1ICE) as (like 3M VHB tape) it seems to be considered a standard component of the drone builder's toolkit and is noted for creating extremely tough and robust bonds.

I just used a ??? metal plate (have a look in Migros and see what it's called and get it's dimensions) on top of a piece of cardboard (for a bit of padding between the metal plate and the Pixhawk) so that the clamps didn't press down directly on the fairly flimsy case of the Pixhawk.

One way catches - not clear in photo.

_27._  
<img src="images/assembly/final-assembly/IMG_20170909_141028.jpg" width="512">

Buzzer and safety button wired on and plugged in. I wired down the buzzer via its mounting holes rather than e.g. trying to attach it by its back to the frame with Blu Tack - as noted previously the back isn't attached very strongly to the rest of the buzzer.

_28._  
<img src="images/assembly/final-assembly/IMG_20170909_141047.jpg" height="512">

Note: in retrospect I wouldn't plug in the buzzer and safety switch as this makes resting the craft upside down impossible. I'd have just taped them down with masking tape to keep them out of the way.

_29 RX in place._  
<img src="images/assembly/final-assembly/IMG_20170909_143340.jpg" width="512">

RX and antennas taped down and RX plugged into Pixhawk.

_30._  
<img src="images/assembly/final-assembly/IMG_20170909_143416.jpg" height="512">

These photos of the RX fail to capture where the servo cable is plugged in - this is much clearer in image 53 (which also shows the ESC control cables much clearer).

_31._  
<img src="images/assembly/final-assembly/IMG_20170909_145435.jpg" height="512">

Routed front "control" wires via underside. Note: I've redone the front cable tie so both power and "control" wires are tied. Note: I couldn't find a definite correct term for the ESC "control" wires/cable.

_35._  
<img src="images/assembly/final-assembly/IMG_20170909_152734.jpg" height="512">

"Control" cables taped down.

In retrospect I'd do the battery test with the solder pads temporally insulated with insulation tape. After this I'd feed the front ESC wires back like this and permanently tape down the middle portion of these wires with tape and then cover the solder pads (and the ends of the tape) with black Sugru (smoothed out with soapy finger tips). Then I'd look at pulling all the "control" wires up to the middle rear of the top plate, possibly temporally taping them in place. All this as part of the soldering section - with the intension then in this section of coiling all four wires into a single coil and connecting them to the Pixhawk before connecting anything else, i.e. before buzzer and safety switch. Whether a single coil works out better than two, as here, remains to be seen.

Covering the main power connector though with Sugru would make it hard to add extra power cables later, e.g. for transmitter, camera and SiK radio (or is powered via Pixhawk?).

Mast setup part 2 (of 2).

_23._  
<img src="images/assembly/final-assembly/IMG_20170908_170322.jpg" width="512">

While the bottom end of the mast is glued into the base the top end is attached to the top plate (above) using a both (that requires a 1.5mm wrench).

Important: when screwing on the plate holding the GPS module to the mast the most important thing is to make sure the arrow on the module is facing exactly forward like the arrow on the Pixhawk.

_37._  
<img src="images/assembly/final-assembly/IMG_20170909_154329.jpg" width="512">

GPS module (and compass) attached to mast.

As noted above in part 1 of the mast setup this was all done a bit prematurely.

Power module taped and wired down. And plugged into PDB.

_41._  
<img src="images/assembly/final-assembly/IMG_20170909_165416.jpg" height="512">

Power module plugged into Pixhawk 1. I want to keep the front area clear for a camera so I routed the cable around the side rather than through one of the slots. This could be cropped much better to focus on power module cable.

<img src="images/assembly/final-assembly/IMG_20170910_141506.jpg" height="512">

Battery strap done up. At 30cm it's at least 4cm too long. Bought 26 and 25cm later and 25cm was perfect. Move up pictures of these from later.

Safety red - battery plugged in.

_Motor test._  
![motor test](images/opentx-companion/motor-test-17pc.png)

The motor test does _not_ require a GPS fix or the ability to arm but the safety must be off/red.

TODO: explain that I say safety off I mean the safety switch has been pressed and gone from flashing to solid red.
