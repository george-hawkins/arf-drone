Final assembly
=============

First pass at final assembly. Next add in the comments included with the photos in Google Photos. Rename the image files to more informative names. Then work in all the Post-its etc.

Order:

* GPS mast base.
* Damping platform.
* ...

Many of the images here can probably be discarded.

Note: some of the tops didn't come with a 3M double sided mounting pad.

Move 05. down to 08 below out into a separate page.

There's little gained in showing any of these bases (except perhaps the FCMODEL) from other angles.

<img src="images/assembly/final-assembly/IMG_20170908_123640.jpg" width="512">

The inner slot is much wider than the outer and you'd need washers with a larger diameter than typically come with the 3.2mm hole size that matches our bolts.

_03._  
<img src="images/assembly/final-assembly/IMG_20170907_115501.jpg" width="512">

You'd have to snip off the inner "loops" of the base rather than let them extend under the damping platform.

Use masking tape to see how the base will sit relative to the top plate and to confirm that how you layout the VHB tape on the damping platform base won't leave any tape entirely over a hole or on top of a bolt head.

Note: the damping platform base has mounting holes and comes with bolts but even if you wanted to you couldn't drill the top plate so that you could bolt it down as the mounting holes end up directly over the plastic ends of the arms.

The platform designed specifically for the Pixhawk, rather than the APM, has a slightly wider base which mean the feet would be over bolts - but this wouldn't cause an issue as unlike the other platform the rubber XXXs don't extend below the bottom of the platform's base plate.

_13._  
<img src="images/assembly/final-assembly/IMG_20170908_135720.jpg" height="512">

VHB neatly cut to the desired lengths and widths with the help of parchment paper.

_14._  
<img src="images/assembly/final-assembly/IMG_20170908_150250.jpg" width="512">

I can't conclusively say, without some lab analysis, that the parchment paper had no detrimental affect on the VHB tape, but it would seem not - I could lift the entire craft (including battery) by the vibration damping platform without the tape giving way.

Added GPS base.

TODO: add picture of washer and split washer, i.e. the bits that didn't come with the mast.

TODO: mark out photos that were taken later to fill in things that had been missed, like using the socket driver via the lower plate slot, and are out of sequence.

_[*] 56._  
<img src="images/assembly/final-assembly/IMG_20170910_232256.jpg" height="512">

Used 5.5mm socket driver - hole in bottom plate makes it easy to get at the bolt but should have done it before mounting anything else.

_[*] 36._  
<img src="images/assembly/final-assembly/IMG_20170909_152942.jpg" height="512">

Important: we need to make sure to keep the left/right cavity free of obstructions so that the battery can be slid in easily - if the nut holding the GPS mast in place descended a few millimeters more it would be a problem.

GPS after inserting mast with epoxy. Excess epoxy cleaned off with tissue. Note: epoxy is very toxic, do not get in eyes and clean off skin.

One way catches - not clear in photo.

_27._  
<img src="images/assembly/final-assembly/IMG_20170909_141028.jpg" width="512">

Buzzer and safety button wired on and plugged in.

_28._  
<img src="images/assembly/final-assembly/IMG_20170909_141047.jpg" height="512">

Note: in retrospect I wouldn't plug in the buzzer and safety switch as this makes resting the craft upside down impossible. I'd have just taped them down with masking tape to keep them out of the way.

_29 RX in place._  
<img src="images/assembly/final-assembly/IMG_20170909_143340.jpg" width="512">

RX and antennas taped down and RX plugged into Pixhawk.

_30._  
<img src="images/assembly/final-assembly/IMG_20170909_143416.jpg" height="512">

These photos of the RX fail to capture where the servo cable is plugged in - this is much clearer in image 53 (which also shows the ESC control cables much clearer).

_31._  
<img src="images/assembly/final-assembly/IMG_20170909_145435.jpg" height="512">

Routed front "control" wires via underside. Note: I've redone the front cable tie so both power and "control" wires are tied. Note: I couldn't find a definite correct term for the ESC "control" wires/cable.

_35._  
<img src="images/assembly/final-assembly/IMG_20170909_152734.jpg" height="512">

"Control" cables taped down.

In retrospect I'd do the battery test with the solder pads temporally insulated with insulation tape. After this I'd feed the front ESC wires back like this and permanently tape down the middle portion of these wires with tape and then cover the solder pads (and the ends of the tape) with black Sugru (smoothed out with soapy finger tips). Then I'd look at pulling all the "control" wires up to the middle rear of the top plate, possibly temporally taping them in place. All this as part of the soldering section - with the intension then in this section of coiling all four wires into a single coil and connecting them to the Pixhawk before connecting anything else, i.e. before buzzer and safety switch.

Covering the main power connector though with Sugru would make it hard to add extra power cables later, e.g. for transmitter, camera and SiK radio (or is powered via Pixhawk?).

GPS module (and compass) attached to mast (with 1.5mm wrench). Done a little prematurely.

_39._  
<img src="images/assembly/final-assembly/IMG_20170909_163018.jpg" height="512">

Battery strap added. Initially I placed the power module over the hole it goes through without taking it into account.

_40._  
<img src="images/assembly/final-assembly/IMG_20170909_164218.jpg" width="512">

Power module taped and wired down. And plugged into PDB.

_41._  
<img src="images/assembly/final-assembly/IMG_20170909_165416.jpg" height="512">

Power module plugged into Pixhawk 1. I want to keep the front area clear for a camera so I routed the cable around the side rather than through one of the slots. This could be cropped much better to focus on power module cable.

Is there a better term than "anti-slip mat"?

_57._  
<img src="images/assembly/final-assembly/IMG_20170912_091607.jpg" width="512">

Battery and silicone mat.

Silicone mat on battery.

Battery in place.

_48 Overlong battery strap._  
<img src="images/assembly/final-assembly/IMG_20170910_141506.jpg" height="512">

Battery strap done up. At 30cm it's at least 4cm too long. Bought 26 and 25cm later and 25cm was perfect. Move up pictures of these from later.

_51._  
<img src="images/assembly/final-assembly/IMG_20170910_160533.jpg" width="512">

Safety red - battery not yet plugged in.

_52._  
<img src="images/assembly/final-assembly/IMG_20170910_160649.jpg" width="512">

Safety red - battery plugged in.

_Motor test._
![motor test](images/opentx-companion/motor-test-17pc.png)

The motor test does _not_ require a GPS fix or the ability to arm but the safety must be off/red.

TODO: explain that I say safety off I mean the safety switch has been pressed and gone from flashing to solid red.

_45 Getting a GPS fix._

_50 Voltage sensor in place._  
<img src="images/assembly/final-assembly/IMG_20170910_151003.jpg" width="512">

Voltage sensor attached to frame. Note: plug sensor cable into RX, spool up and cable tie _before_ taping down RX and make sure RX is far enough forward that sensor cable doesn't poke into battery strap. Move note about plugging in S.PORT cable up to where you taped down the RX.
