Notes:

* Craft and Theory also have a [UK distributor](https://www.3dxr.co.uk/product/craft-theory-telemetry-cable/) but the cheapest international shipping option from the UK distributor is GBP 20 vs just USD 5 from the US site (and despite listing a worst-case international delivery time of 6 weeks it took less than 2 weeks for them to ship to Switzerland).
* I ordered my F450 frame and propulsion system from the Swiss supplier AEROdron - but despite listing a delivery time of 5 to 10 working days it took more than a month in the end. Initially I thought I'd fallen for a scam as they didn't respond to my initial emails but it turns out they're a very small operation and were very friendly when I talked to them on the phone. They are probably just low down on DJI's priority list for delivery of hobbyist parts like this (as opposed to the more profitable ready built consumer drones Phantom which had immediate availablity).

Additional parts:

* Single 2mm hex screw driver [Conrad CH](http://www.conrad.ch/ce/de/product/817256/Werkstatt-Innen-Sechskantschraubendreher-Wera-354-Schluesselweite-Metrisch-2-mm-Klingenlaenge-75-mm).
* [100mW telemetry kit](https://www.unmannedtechshop.co.uk/100mw-ardupilot-unmanned-telemetry-kit-v2-433mhz/) as additional part of Pixhawk bundle.

TODO: decide on whether to really list the telemetry kit here once you've worked with it.
