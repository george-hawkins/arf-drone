Pixhawk tones
=============

Github Flavored Markdown does not allow the use of the HTML [`<audio>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio) tag. So the content for this page can be found in [`pixhawk-tones.html`](pixhawk-tones.html) which you can view properly [here](https://george-hawkins.github.io/arf-drone/pixhawk-tones.html) on Github Pages.
