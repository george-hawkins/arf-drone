1-old-setup.param - the configuration still in place from the old build.
2-recalibrated.param - the configuration after recalibrating for the new build.
3-rebooted.param - the configuration after rebooting after recalibrating.
4-post-autotune.param - the configuration after running auto-tune.
5-second-autotune.param - the configuration after running a second auto-tune on a windless day and with a fresh batter (rather than at the end of the battery's power as previously).

Note that auto-tune takes several minutes, twitching on each axis in turn.
