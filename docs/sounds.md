TODO: merge with [`voice.md`](voice.md)

TODO: provide some kind of pointers to getting nicer sounds than "flight mode 1" etc. going on the transmitter.

There are no end of sound packs for OpenTX - the most popular seems to be one called "Amber". For whatever reason the standard sound packs found under <http://voices-21.open-tx.org/opentx-taranisplus/en/> (2.1 is the latest version for which sound packs are available like this) don't include sounds like stabilize, Amber is included here under the `thirdparty` directory but has had sounds like stabilize removed. The 2.1 version of Amber linked to from <http://open-txu.org/home/v2-1-resources/> does have these sounds.

2.1 sounds however are not compatible with 2.2 so we'll have to wait for compatible sound packs which contain these sounds. There is an Amber sound pack linked to on <http://open-txu.org/v2-2-resources-2/> but it doesn't contain a CSV as seems to be expected for a sound pack.

TODO: when 2.2.0 finally comes out see if there's a sound pack with "stblzmd", "althld" etc. that you see in various videos (and which are contained in the full Amber sound pack).
