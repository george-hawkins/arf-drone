I was put off adding the landing gear by two things. The most important being the realization that it would make the craft much taller - without the landing gear legs you can transport the craft in a bag, with them you'd really need some kind of more substantial box-like case, making it harder to transport without a car. The second thing that put me off was this [blog post](http://diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/be-careful-with-the-new-dji-landing-gear) that showed that the legs could act like levers and increase the damage to the frame in the case of the crash. This became a real worry as crashing turned out to be a major part of getting used to the small practice drone that I bought before flying this build. However the general concensus seems to be that the legs more often help to absorb the shock of a crash with the situation reported in the blog being contrary to the norm.
