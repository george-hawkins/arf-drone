Build

* [`parts.md`](parts.md) - all parts required for this build with explanations of the major parts.
* [`transmitter-getting-started.md`](transmitter-getting-started.md) - introduction to the transmitter along with basic setup.
* [`receiver.md`](receiver.md) - introduction to the receiver and how to upgrade it via the transmitter.
* [`electronics-assembly.md`](electronics-assembly.md) - wiring up the core electronics, i.e. the Pixhawk, GPS etc.
* [`stick-setup.md`](stick-setup.md) - disabling self centering for the transmitter throttle.
* [`transmitter-model-setup.md`](transmitter-model-setup.md) - configuring a model in the transmitter.
* [`binding.md`](binding.md) - binding the receiver to the transmitter.
* [`transmitter-flight-modes.md`](transmitter-flight-modes.md) - setting up flight modes for a model. TODO: move out unrelated sections.
* [`frame-parts.md`](frame-parts.md) - details of the parts that come with the frame kit and propulsion system.
* [`pdb-soldering.md`](pdb-soldering.md) - soldering up the PDB.
* [`frame-assembly.md`](frame-assembly.md) - assembling the frame.
* [`pixhawk-setup.md`](pixhawk-setup.md) - configuring the Pixhawk.
* [`final-assembly.md`](final-assembly.md) - assembling the frame and electronics for the first flight.

In writing the [`parts.md`](parts.md) page I started including so many side notes that they started clogging up the whole thing, so I've moved these notes out into [`notes.md`](notes.md). They're worth scanning over quickly. They cover:

* Brief notes on [clockwise and counterclockwise motors](notes.md#motor-direction) and the [external LED and USB connector](notes.md#external-led-and-usb-port).
* The [F450 ARF kit](notes.md#f450-arf-kit) and why I choose to buy the F450 frame and propulsion system as separate components rather than bundled as an ARF kit.
* The [E300 vs E305 vs E310](notes.md#e300-vs-e305-vs-e310) propulsion systems and the [E305 motor variants](notes.md#e305-motor-variants).
* The [power connectors](notes.md#power-connectors) of the power module and the charger.
* The [LiPo batteries](notes.md#batteries), the [charger](notes.md#charger), the battery alarm and the battery safety bag.
* The [IMU and MCU](notes.md#imu-and-mcu) - the core parts of the flight controller and how you can experiment with them.
* [Vibration](notes.md#vibration) and why a vibration damping kit might improve the performance of the sensors in the flight controller.
* Predefined [waypoints](notes.md#waypoints) and in-flight drone-to-computer communication (as opposed to using the hand-held transmitter).
* The [Pixhawk 2.1](notes.md#pixhawk-21) and some background leading to my choice of the classic Pixhawk flight controller.
* [Pixhawk.org vs the ArduPilot site](notes.md#pixhawkorg-vs-ardupilotorg).
* [Bags and cases](notes.md#bag--case) and why the size of the F450 makes it hard to find a good bag for it.
* [Chinese copies](notes.md#chinese-copies) and how buying drone parts is a case of caveat emptor.
