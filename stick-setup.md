Stick configuration
-------------------

Lot's of tutorials on the transmitter go into intense detail on choosing a configuration of the sticks.

There are a number of popular conventions as to stick configuration, i.e. whether moving the left or right stick up and down controls throttle etc.

The most popular conventions have been given names - very uninformative names - "mode 1", "mode 2" etc.

By far the most common mode is mode 2 and this is the default for the Q X7 so there's no need to go into detail on how to change the mode. The next most common is mode 1 and then the other modes almost never come up.

If you're interested in the different setups of the different modes see Oscar Liang's description of [modes](https://oscarliang.com/choose-rc-transmitter-quadcopter/#modes) but before you do a note...

The stick directions have names, people who come to quadcopter flying from flying RC planes tend to continue using names that meant something for planes but don't mean little for quadcopters - i.e. aileron, elevator and rudder. For people less wedded to the thinking that went with planes the terms pitch, yaw and roll are used. Both schools use the term throttle.

If you're new to RC then neither set of terms may mean much so here's a simple table:

| Planes | Multicopters | Meaning |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| elevator | pitch | go forward or backward |
| aileron | roll | go left or right |
| rudder | yaw | turn clockwise or counterclockwise |
| throttle | throttle | go up or down |

The "term" elevator seems particularly confusing - it doesn't mean up and down as one might guess. Hopefully the distinction between _going_ right and _turning_ clockwise is clear - if you're used to first person shooters then _going_ right is the equivalent of siddling left crabwise while still facing the same direction while _turning_ clockwise means staying put but chaning the direction your facing (turning round to face right, turning further to face back and so on until you do a full 360).

I couldn't find a perfect page showing the use of the terms pitch, roll etc. This [page](http://newatlas.com/drone-school-quadcopter-transmitter-mode-1-2/40847/) clearly labels the sticks for mode 1 and 2 while this [page](https://www.wearechampionmag.com/quadcopter-transmitter-mode2-vs-mode1-difference) shows nicely the affect of the controls on the drone (unfortunately it uses the term roll for forward and backward, as well as left and right, rather than the more common _pitch_ forward and backward).

Another aspect of stick setup, that isn't fixed before flying, is trim - I won't go into that here but you can see the digital trim buttons if you go back to the diagrams I used when first introducing the transmitter. For details on this see the "controller trim" section of this [page](https://dronebuff.com/drone-controller/) and see this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk2h06Ql3cM) (he's not terribly successful at getting trim right but you get the idea).

Disabling throttle self centering
---------------------------------

The Q X7 comes with both sticks self centering in all directions, i.e. if you let go of either it returns to the center point.

However throttle, i.e. up/down, controls overall power to the propellars - when throttle is all the way down the propellars should be off and when its all the way up they should be turning at maximum. So you don't really want throttle just springing half way to a value between these.

Most people want throttle at zero when they're getting ready for talkoff and then they want it just staying where it is if they take their finger off it.

Aside: older consumer drones used to behave much like this too, at least for the low throttle case. On older DJI models the throttle only self centered if you took your finger off it when it was above the midpoint - on the latest models though the throttle always self centers with the center point meaning "hold current altitude" while up and down mean ascend and descend respectively.

To disable self centering on the throttle you have to open up the transmitter - this isn't a big issue, unlike many consumer electronic items that come with strick injunctions against opening them up it's expected that you'll take apart the transmitter (though if you break anything that's still your problem).

The whole mechnical mechanism behind a stick is called a gimbal and you often hear people using the terms stick and gimbal interchangeably (though confusingly the term gimbal on its own often means the remote control camera setup that's common on many drones these days - to see the clear distinction between the two see e.g. the [gimbal sticks section](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/radios-receivers-1/parts-accessories/gimbal-sticks-extensions.html) and the [camera gimbals section](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/multi-rotors-drones/camera-gimbals.html) on the HobbyKing online store).

I'm not going to provide instructions on disabling self centering for the throttle, instead I suggest watching these video:

The RCdiy video is accompanied by an excellent [page](http://rcdiy.ca/taranis-q-x7-tutorial-first-flight-setup/) that describes the disassembly and provides lots of close up pictures (along with lots of other details on getting the transmitter set up).
