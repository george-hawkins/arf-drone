Taranis Q X7 playlist - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiYYhnH4BhI-ot9OQ9djvRaacFHboFqC2

Includes:

* Failsafe: no pulses - https://youtu.be/LuJ_K0pOJkE?t=330
* Binding: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH_RuVbF2YU cf with binding video below.
* Wiring telemetry: https://youtu.be/WKsFG29Q5mQ - not for Pixhawk but still intesting, zip forward to 8:08 once he gets aways from the receiver and info the flight controller (and then its software).
* Configuring telemetry: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n09q26Gh858

I don't like his throttle de-self-centering video so find another one.

Note: in one of these videos he does use a blank SD card - he never plugs the SD into his own computer. He sets up the initial contents via the USB to the transmitter.

No pulses is the preferred option - see http://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/radio-failsafe.html#receiver-and-flight-controller-set-up
In their video they setup the failsafe via the receiver - we should do it via the transmitter - but the video shows how to test things - https://youtu.be/FhKREgqjCpM?t=93 - note that I think they've got an ancient PX4 so arming is different.

DroneTrest:

* Binding - http://www.dronetrest.com/t/how-to-bind-your-x8r-receiver-to-taranis-x9d/633 cf the video with above, note image shows that you only get max 8 channels out so up above video shouldn't have 1-16 selected.

Painless360:

* Model setup: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIR85KOqIAo&feature=youtu.be&t=170
* Throttle de-self-centering: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD3ojhwVmrI&feature=youtu.be&t=291 - jump on to 10:38 once he's done the gibles and see basic OS setup.

Note: you can see there is a backup battery for the RTC.

RCdiy doing same with throttles but also lots of other basic OS setup:

DJI videos:

* <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUTHIL_Xfcc> - assembling the original F450 kit.
* <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_Rvi7xQLdw> - assembly with the (then) newer E300 propulsion system (now replaced by the E305). Note: with the F450 you don't have to use the E305 PDB as the bottom plate of the F450 is a PDB.
* <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJZa7p3rsCU> - installing the Naza M V2 - while I didn't use this flight controller it's interesting to see how everything is fitted in.

Note: according to one of the comments the "video shows the base plate being mounted sideways. If you want to mount a front facing camera gimbal you should mount the base plate the other way." And someone else comments that "she moves the solder around with the iron and that means there is too little heat and the cable should be still until the solder has gotten hard again ... give a little more heat and hold it still a little longer after removing the heat! Better to use a more powerful soldering iron, then the time to heat it up is less and the heat doesn't go that deep in the board and the conector."
